Next, for all neighbours of Z, we check which ones are not in N', which is just Y
So we consider if adding the cost of Z to Y is cheaper than Y's current cost
Cost of Y is currently 5, just its initial value, the cost of Z + the cost of Z to Y is 4, so travelling via Z is cheaper
So, X's routing table gets updated: Y's cost is set to 4, and Y's "next hop" value is set to Z
(So here, Y's value gets updated, so it find's Z's current "next hop" value, which is Z, and sets it's "next hop" value to Z in the routing table!)
Also Z's path array gets copied, as it is the previous node, and Y gets added to the array, and the array is set to Y's path array [Z,Y]
(If the cost between Y and Z + Y was equal, we would choose to ignore Z and keep the cost of travelling directly to Y, since this is less hops! Checked via the length of Y's path array, and Z's path array + 1)
(If the cost and hop number between Y and Z + Y was equal, we would ignore Z and just keep the current path between X and Y, since Y comes first from Z in alphabetical order)

On the final loop, Y is not in N' and its distance is a minimum just because it's the only node left!
Y gets added to N'
But Y now has no neighbours no in N', both X and Z are in, so no cost updating happens
Finally, N' = N, so the loop exits
X's routing table looks like:
Y|Z|4
Z|Z|1

Finally, need to test GetRoutingTable(startNode, nodeGroup, startNodeLSDB) works with all the outlined edge cases in the "Important notes" above, mostly sorting things by alphabetical order to decide ties, or picking the least hops out of 2 equal cost paths.
Sorting things by alphabetical order should be easy, just have to keep an array of various things are call a sort function, but picking the least hops should be a simple as comparing the lengths of the path arrays of the old path, and the path to the new node +1 (+1 to add the hop we're considering from the new node, to the old node)

# Generating output

"""
Once requested nodes to print are known (maybe stored in a nodesToPrint array) the Generating output should be as simple as reading the appropriate values from the 3 main tables.

For the node names stage, no output is needed

For the LINKSTATE stage, first the neighbour, edge and nodeGroup tables would have to be updated.
Then, the GetRoutingTable() function would be called on each node on each array in the nodeGroups array, and its result put into the routingTables for each node
Finally, for each of the nodes in the nodesToPrint array, print out (using print()) that node's corresponding values in the neighbour, edge, and routing tables, in the appropriate format.

Neighbour tables need to print out nodes in alphabetical order.
LSDB tables need to print out nodes in alphabetical order of the start node, and if there's a tie, in alphabetical order of the end node.
Routing tables need to print in alphabetical order of the destination node names.
Nodes can be floating on their own with no connections, in that case, they will have all empty tables, but make sure to still print their empty tables out if requested!

e.g for X-Z 1 X,Y:
X Neighbour Table:
Z|1

X LSDB:
X|Z|1

X Routing Table:
Z|Z|1

Y Neighbour Table:

Y LSDB:

Y Routing Table:


For the UPDATE stage, the behaviour can be exactly the same as the LINKSTATE stage, so long as the old input values are override by the new ones before GetRoutingTable() is called on the big nodeGroups array.
